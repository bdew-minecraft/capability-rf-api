# Experimental Capability-based RF API

~~This is a proposed API currently being discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/44rdqz/rfc_forge_capability_based_rf_api_for_189/).~~

This is no longer relevant, since there is now an [official RF API for 1.8](https://github.com/CoFH/RedstoneFlux-API/commit/e75851870680af2cb271006d3997902ab3e741b5) (that doesn't use capabilities). Meh.

The code is loosely based on the original [RF API](https://github.com/CoFH/RedstoneFlux-API), and licensed under LGPLv3.
