# Experimental Capability-based RF API

This is a proposed API currently being discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/44rdqz/rfc_forge_capability_based_rf_api_for_189/).

The code is loosely based on the original [RF API](https://github.com/CoFH/RedstoneFlux-API), and licensed under LGPLv3.
